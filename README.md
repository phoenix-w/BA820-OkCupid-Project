## OkCupid User Profile Analysis

### Project Summary
As a team, we were tasked with locating a dataset of our interest, applying unsupervised learning algorithms to it, and obtaining business insights. We chose an OkCupid dataset because of the varied and interesting features, the sizable number of observations, and the relevance of the subject matter.

### Project Objective
We aim to understanding the virtual dating landscape  and discover the types of users that are on the dating app OkCupid. By creating distinct clusters of users, we can help users make better decisions while swiping, leading to better results for match seekers.

### Data Source
Our dataset was taken from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/andrewmvd/okcupid-profiles). It contains 59,946 rows and 31 columns. Each row represents an anonymous user profile found on OkCupid, with structured information as well as open-ended descriptions. There are 3 numeric columns in the dataset – age, height, and income – while the rest of them contain categorical or textual data.
